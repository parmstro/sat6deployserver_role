# Playbook to deploy a new server using satellite via the REST API
# 
# All the variables required by the role should be described in
# a newserver vars file. This should be able to handle dictionaries of 
# vars for the role... i.e. multiple builds at once
# this is because the build process is async with Satellite
#
# Alternately this is called from Tower with vars
